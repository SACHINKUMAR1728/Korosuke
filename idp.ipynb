The student council typically consists of various positions, including President, Vice-President, General Secretary, Treasurer, and Wing Leaders.\\n\\nThe main responsibility of the student council is to listen to the concerns and ideas of students, and then work with other university departments and administrators to address those concerns and make positive changes. This can include organizing events, planning activities, and advocating for policy changes that benefit students.\\n\\nIn addition to these responsibilities, some student councils may also have specific goals or focus areas, such as promoting diversity and inclusion, supporting student mental health, or enhancing campus sustainability.\\n\\nOverall, the student council plays a crucial role in bringing together students from different backgrounds and disciplines, providing a platform for their voices to be heard, and working together to create a positive and supportive university community.'"
